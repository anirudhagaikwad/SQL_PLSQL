1)Calculate total salary by department :
Write block that iterates through each department in table and calculates the total salary of EMP in that department and print department_name and total_salary
DECLARE
    v_dept_id DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID%TYPE;
    v_dept_name DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME%TYPE;
    v_total_salary NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR dept_rec IN (SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM DEPARTMENTS) LOOP
        v_dept_id := dept_rec.DEPARTMENT_ID;
        v_dept_name := dept_rec.DEPARTMENT_NAME;

        SELECT SUM(SALARY)
        INTO v_total_salary
        FROM EMPLOYEES
        WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = v_dept_id;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Department: ' || v_dept_name || ' | Total Salary: ' || NVL(v_total_salary, 0));
    END LOOP;
END;



2)Display EMP and their regions : iterate through EMP table,for each emp find their region_name using relationship of EMP,DEPT,LOC,COUNTRY,REGIONS tables ,print emp name and their region
DECLARE
    v_region_name REGIONS.REGION_NAME%TYPE;
BEGIN
    FOR emp_rec IN (SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES) LOOP
        FOR dept_rec IN (SELECT LOCATION_ID FROM DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = emp_rec.DEPARTMENT_ID) LOOP
            FOR loc_rec IN (SELECT COUNTRY_ID FROM LOCATIONS WHERE LOCATION_ID = dept_rec.LOCATION_ID) LOOP
                FOR country_rec IN (SELECT REGION_ID FROM COUNTRIES WHERE COUNTRY_ID = loc_rec.COUNTRY_ID) LOOP
                    SELECT REGION_NAME
                    INTO v_region_name
                    FROM REGIONS
                    WHERE REGION_ID = country_rec.REGION_ID;

                    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee: ' || emp_rec.FIRST_NAME || ' ' || emp_rec.LAST_NAME || ' | Region: ' || v_region_name);
                END LOOP;
            END LOOP;
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;
END;



3)Identify Departments with employees in specific regions
print region_name and name of dept in that region

DECLARE
    v_region_name REGIONS.REGION_NAME%TYPE;
    v_department_name DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME%TYPE;
BEGIN
    FOR region_rec IN (SELECT REGION_ID, REGION_NAME FROM REGIONS) LOOP
        v_region_name := region_rec.REGION_NAME;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Region: ' || v_region_name);

        FOR dept_rec IN (SELECT DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM DEPARTMENTS WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (
                            SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID
                            FROM EMPLOYEES
                            WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (
                                SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID
                                FROM DEPARTMENTS
                                WHERE LOCATION_ID IN (
                                    SELECT LOCATION_ID
                                    FROM LOCATIONS
                                    WHERE COUNTRY_ID IN (
                                        SELECT COUNTRY_ID
                                        FROM COUNTRIES
                                        WHERE REGION_ID = region_rec.REGION_ID
                                    )
                                )
                            )
                        )) LOOP
            v_department_name := dept_rec.DEPARTMENT_NAME;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('  Department: ' || v_department_name);
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;
END;



4)Count Employees Per Region ,print region_name and employee_count

DECLARE
    v_region_name REGIONS.REGION_NAME%TYPE;
    v_employee_count NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR region_rec IN (SELECT REGION_ID, REGION_NAME FROM REGIONS) LOOP
        v_region_name := region_rec.REGION_NAME;

        SELECT COUNT(*)
        INTO v_employee_count
        FROM EMPLOYEES
        WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IN (
            SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID
            FROM DEPARTMENTS
            WHERE LOCATION_ID IN (
                SELECT LOCATION_ID
                FROM LOCATIONS
                WHERE COUNTRY_ID IN (
                    SELECT COUNTRY_ID
                    FROM COUNTRIES
                    WHERE REGION_ID = region_rec.REGION_ID
                )
            )
        );

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Region: ' || v_region_name || ' | Employee Count: ' || v_employee_count);
    END LOOP;
END;

5)Categorize Employees Based on Salary
DECLARE
    v_salary_category VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
    FOR emp_rec IN (SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES) LOOP
        CASE
            WHEN emp_rec.SALARY < 5000 THEN
                v_salary_category := 'Low Salary';
            WHEN emp_rec.SALARY BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN
                v_salary_category := 'Medium Salary';
            ELSE
                v_salary_category := 'High Salary';
        END CASE;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee: ' || emp_rec.FIRST_NAME || ' ' || emp_rec.LAST_NAME || ' | Salary: ' || emp_rec.SALARY || ' | Category: ' || v_salary_category);
    END LOOP;
END;

1)Create Procedure to insert employee into table and show new employee from table 
2)Create Function to calculate Tax on employee salary and call this function within procedure where you get emp_id,emp_name,emp_salary with it show calculated tax
