Cursors and records are two distinct concepts in database programming, often used in conjunction to retrieve and manipulate data. Here are the key differences between them:

1. **Purpose and Usage:**

   - **Cursor:** A cursor is a database object used to retrieve and manipulate data from a result set, typically generated by a SQL query. Cursors are used to iterate through rows of data and perform operations on each row individually. Cursors are primarily used for data retrieval and manipulation within SQL procedures.

   - **Record:** A record is a composite data structure used to store multiple values or fields together. Records are not directly associated with database queries; instead, they are used within programming languages (such as PL/SQL) to define custom data structures that can hold data retrieved from queries, as well as other structured data. Records are often used for custom data manipulation or passing structured data between program components.

2. **Scope:**

   - **Cursor:** Cursors are scoped to SQL procedures, such as stored procedures or functions, and are primarily used for data manipulation within these procedures.

   - **Record:** Records are typically defined within program blocks or modules and are used within the programming logic of that block or module. They are not limited to database procedures and can be used in various parts of a program.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. **Data Retrieval:**

   - **Cursor:** Cursors are explicitly opened, fetched, and closed to retrieve data from a result set. Cursors provide fine-grained control over data retrieval and allow you to iterate through rows step by step.

   - **Record:** Records are used to store data fetched from a result set in a single row. They do not have inherent mechanisms for fetching data; data must be explicitly assigned to record fields.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. **Data Manipulation:**

   - **Cursor:** Cursors are often used to update, delete, or insert data into a database table based on the retrieved result set. They allow you to perform data manipulation operations on the database.

   - **Record:** Records are typically used for data storage and manipulation within a program's logic. They may be used to process and transform data before or after it's stored in a database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. **Examples:**

   - **Cursor Example:**
-->     
     DECLARE
       CURSOR emp_cursor IS
         SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;
       emp_rec emp_cursor%ROWTYPE;
     BEGIN
       OPEN emp_cursor;
       LOOP
         FETCH emp_cursor INTO emp_rec;
         EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
         -- Process and manipulate emp_rec data here
       END LOOP;
       CLOSE emp_cursor;
     END;
     

   - **Record Example:**
-->
     DECLARE
       r_employee EMPLOYEES%ROWTYPE;
     BEGIN
       -- Get employee data of employee id 100
       SELECT * INTO r_employee 
       FROM employees
       WHERE employee_id = 100;

       -- Change the employee's last name
       r_employee.last_name := 'Smith';

       -- Update the employee
       UPDATE employees
       SET 
         first_name = r_employee.first_name,
         last_name = r_employee.last_name
       WHERE employee_id = r_employee.employee_id;
     END;
-------------------------------------------------------------------     

In summary, cursors are primarily used for data retrieval and manipulation within database procedures, while records are used to define custom data structures within programming languages for data storage and manipulation. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, although they can sometimes be used together for more complex data processing tasks.
