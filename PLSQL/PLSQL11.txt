PL/SQL Cursor
--------------------
When you work with Oracle database, you work with a complete set of rows returned from an SELECT statement. However the application in some cases cannot work effectively with the entire result set, therefore, the database server needs to provide a mechanism for the application to work with one row or a subset of the result set at a time. As the result, Oracle created PL/SQL cursor to provide these extensions.

A PL/SQL cursor is a pointer that points to the result set of an SQL query against database tables.

-->
-- Declare variables to hold cursor data
DECLARE
  v_first_name employees.first_name%TYPE;
  v_last_name employees.last_name%TYPE;
  v_department_name departments.department_name%TYPE;
BEGIN
  -- Open the cursor
  OPEN cur_chief;

  -- Loop through the cursor's result set
  LOOP
    -- Fetch data from the cursor into variables
    FETCH cur_chief INTO v_first_name, v_last_name, v_department_name;

    -- Exit the loop when there are no more rows to fetch
    EXIT WHEN cur_chief%NOTFOUND;

    -- Display the fetched data
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('First Name: ' || v_first_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Last Name: ' || v_last_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Department Name: ' || v_department_name);
  END LOOP;

  -- Close the cursor
  CLOSE cur_chief;
END;

DECLARE
  -- declare a cursor
  CURSOR cur_chief IS
      SELECT first_name,
             last_name,
             department_name
      FROM employees e
      INNER JOIN departments d ON d.manager_id = e.employee_id;
  r_chief cur_chief%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN cur_chief;
  LOOP
    -- fetch information from cursor into record
    FETCH cur_chief INTO r_chief;
    EXIT WHEN cur_chief%NOTFOUND;
    -- print department - chief
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r_chief.department_name || ' - ' ||
                         r_chief.first_name || ',' ||
                         r_chief.last_name);
