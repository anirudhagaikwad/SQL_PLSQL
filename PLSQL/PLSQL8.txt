1) PL/SQL GOTO statement :
 GOTO statement allows you to jump to a specific executable statement in the same execution section of a PL/SQL block.
 
-->
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON SIZE 1000000;
BEGIN 
  GOTO label_1;
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Right after the GOTO statement');
  <<label_1>>
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('It is here!');
END;

When PL/SQL reaches the GOTO statement, it skips everything and immediately jumps to the target label i.e. label_1 and it displays the message It is here

The PL/SQL GOTO statement has a bad reputation because it makes the code hard to understand and difficult to debug. In general, the PL/SQL GOTO statement should be avoided and replaced by other statements such as IF or CASE statement.
