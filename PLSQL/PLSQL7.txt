1)PL/SQL FOR Loop :
PL/SQL FOR loop is an iterative statement that allows you to execute a sequence of statements a fixed number of times.
FOR loop_counter IN [REVERSE] lower_bound .. higher_bound
LOOP
   sequence_of_statements;
END LOOP;

By default, the loop iterates in the upward fashion from the lower_bound to the higher_bound. However, if you want to force the loop to iterate in a downward way from the higher_bound to the lower_bound, you can use the REVERSE keyword after the IN keyword.

  n_times NUMBER := 10;
BEGIN
  FOR n_i IN 1..n_times LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(n_i);
  END LOOP;
END;
