##Exporting SQL Data from ORACLE:##

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Use SQL*Plus to connect to your Oracle database:
-->
   sqlplus username/password@db_instance
  
   Replace `username`, `password`, and `db_instance` with your actual Oracle credentials and database instance.

3. To export data to a SQL file, you can use the `spool` command. For example:
-->
   spool export_data.sql

4. Write your SQL query or commands to extract the data. For example:
-->
   SELECT * FROM your_table;

5. To end the spooling, type:
-->   spool off


6. Exit SQL*Plus:
-->
   exit

##Importing SQL Data in ORACLE:##

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Use SQL*Plus to connect to your Oracle database as before:
-->
   sqlplus username/password@db_instance

3. To run the SQL script you've exported, use the `@` symbol followed by the script's file path:
-->
   @import_data.sql

eg.->@d:\pls.sql
   
   Replace `import_data.sql` with the actual file path to your SQL script.

4. SQL*Plus will execute the commands in the script, importing the data into the database.

Keep in mind that this is a basic method, and for more complex tasks or larger datasets, you might want to consider using Oracle Data Pump (expdp and impdp) or a database management tool like SQL Developer, which provides more advanced features and options for exporting and importing data.
