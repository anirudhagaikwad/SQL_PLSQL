Python Project Description 

### Project Description: Python Core API with Database Integration

Objective:  
The project involves developing a RESTful API using only Python's core libraries without relying on external frameworks. The API facilitates interaction with a database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API is tested and verified using Postman to ensure its functionality and reliability.

Features:  
1. Database Integration:  
   - A relational database (e.g., SQLite or MySQL) is used for storing and retrieving data.  
   - Python's `sqlite3` or `mysql.connector` library is employed for database operations.

2. API Development:  
   - Python's `http.server` or `BaseHTTPServer` is used to set up the HTTP server.  
   - Endpoints for CRUD operations are implemented:
     - GET: Fetch data from the database.
     - POST: Add new data to the database.
     - PUT: Update existing data in the database.
     - DELETE: Remove data from the database.

3. Data Validation:  
   - Input data is validated using Python's core utilities to ensure accuracy and prevent errors.

4. Testing:  
   - Postman is used to test the API endpoints for functionality, error handling, and performance.

Technology Stack:  
- Programming Language: Python (core libraries only)  
- Database: SQLite/MySQL (using Python's built-in libraries)  
- Tools: Postman for API testing  

Use Case:  
This project is ideal for developers aiming to understand API development fundamentals without frameworks. It provides a foundational understanding of how to interact with databases and build APIs using Python's core capabilities.
